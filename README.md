# test_kitchen_ad_helpers
Cookbook which performs a very basic installation of MSSQL Server 2014 Express using the [BoxStarter Cookbook](https://github.com/mwrock/boxstarter-cookbook) and [MsSqlServer2014Express](https://chocolatey.org/packages/MsSqlServer2014Express) Chocolatey package.  
This cookbook is useful as an example of how to install and configure MSSQL in a test-kitchen compatible manner and is also used by the [test_kitchen_mssql_template](https://github.com/Sam-Martin/test_kitchen_mssql_template).
